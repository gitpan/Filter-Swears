=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Filter::Swears module will filter words or phrases from a string.

The new() method accepts a hashref of options.

char   - The character to substitute filtered words with.
string - The string to filter.
strict - Set to 1 for strict filtering or 0 for gentle filtering.

You may pass in an arrayref of words or phrases to the parse() method or a system file path.
The file should contain one word or phrase per line to filter out.

Using non strict filtering would filter the following (amongst other combinations)...

boobies
b.o.o.b.i.e.s
b_o_o_b_i_e_s
bboooobbiieess

..and any other combination of characters between the letters.

Strict spacing would catch:

b
o
o
b
i
e
s

or b o o b i e s
